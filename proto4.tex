Our aim to embedd IO into the DSL

So something like a "data" declaration for IO operations

\begin{minted}[linenos]{haskell}
data IOAction a = 
-- A container for a value of type a.
                  Return a 
-- A container holding a String to be printed to stdout, followed by another IOAction a.
                | Put String (IOAction a) 
-- A container holding a function from String -> IOAction a, which can be applied to whatever String is read from stdin.
                | Get (String -> IOAction a)
\end{minted}

So when the program is getting interpreted the interpreter encounters an IO operation which then gets "interpreted" to the above and it 
continues normally.

The interpreted program is still pure since the IO actions have not been executed 

if the running is done inside a monad then the IO still is pure.
