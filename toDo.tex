\textit{\color{red} This Chapter needs to be removed from the final
  work.}

\textbf{Meeting on 5th Novemeber 2015} 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Write about this chapter and chapter conclusion for all chapters

\item Till haskell why haskell chapter 11 wait for feedback

\item In the remaining chapters write according to flow == move around stuff or add new content.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\item [\textbf{2015-10-29}]
\item Abstract is too long and incorrect.
\item Remove first \P{} from intro.
\item Thesis statement is close to being an abstract.

\item [\textbf{Either}]
\item
  We need a convention for what words to capitalize in chapter and
  section titles.

\item [\textbf{Mehul}]

\item
  Chapter 13.5 needs fleshing out.

\item
  \textcolor{red}{Rewrite (Section) Chapter 3.2}\,.
  You are now in a position to state what your contributions are.
  In some sense everything else flows around this.

\item
  Fix the reference at the bottom of page~2:\\
  \Verb!citewikipro- log,somogyi1995logic,website:prolog1000db.!  \textbf{SOLVED}
\item
  Write enough of Chapters \ref{proto1}--\ref{proto4} that we can decide
  what material is needed in Chapters~ \ref{chap:quasiquotation},
  \ref{chap:metasyntacticvariables},
  and~\ref{chap:relatedtermskeywords}.
\item {}[mainly done]
  If you don't like the shape of the paragraphs that you get without
  \Verb!paragraph!, use something like
  \begin{Verbatim}
\setlength{\parindent}{3em}
\setlength{\parskip}{2\baselineskip}
  \end{Verbatim}
  to adjust either the initial paragraph indent, or the inter-paragraph
  space.

\item
  Rewrite (Section) Chapter 3 in formal English.

\item
  ``re-curses'' means to swear again (\textit{p} 9). \textbf{Changed to recurs}
\item
  I am not sure that I agree with the use of ``reflective'' on
  \textit{p}~8 (\textit{l}~25).  Reflection often means run-time
  introspection (for instance the Java \Verb!.getClass()! method).
  In computer science, reflection is the ability of a computer program to examine (see type introspection) and modify its own structure and behavior (specifically the values, meta-data, properties and functions) at runtime.
  
\item
  Supply your credentials in the front material (what degrees do you
  have?).
  (Search for \Verb!%% Supply your credentials! in \Verb!proposal1.tex!\,.)

\item
  The abstract is too long. UNBC guidelines limit Masters' theses
  abstracts to 150 words.

\item
  Citation \Verb!logic-classes! is not defined (in
  \Verb!./prologinhaskell.tex!). 

\item [\textbf{David}]
\item Clean up the non-exclusive license page in unbcthesis.cls
\item Incorporate unbcthesis.cls into Mehul's work.
\item Review Chapter 2
\item Review Chapter 3
\item Review Chapter 4
\item Review Chapter 5
\item Review Chapter 6
\item Review Chapter 7
\item Review Chapter 8
\item Review Chapter 18

\end{enumerate}

\section{Editing suggestions from David}\label{sec:edit-sugg-david}

\paragraph{Thoughts on Chapter~\ref{proto2.1}}\mbox{}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Do not use naked \Verb!\ref!s:
  ``\textit{the generic methodology from \ref{proto1}}''
  should be
  ``\textsl{the generic methodology from \textbf{\upshape
      Chapter}~\ref{proto1}}''.
\item
  You should say more about \cite{prolog-lib}, either here or in an
  earlier section and reference that discussion here.  For instance, it
  isn't clear that \Verb!prolog-0.2.0.1! comes from~ \cite{prolog-lib}.
\item
  See my comments below.
  I suspect that longer listings should be separate figures.
\item
  Line~7 on p~55 is not a complete sentence.
\item
  I suspect that \S~\ref{proto2.1}.2 should start with a sentence like 
  \begin{quote}\color[rgb]{0.3,0,0.6}\small\singlespacing
    The \Verb!prolog-0.2.0.1! (\cite{prolog-lib}) was written by Indira
    Ghandi and consists of 718 \progLang{Haskell} files.
    It implements data base assertions and cuts but lacks any IO
    facilities\dots
  \end{quote}
  and then go on to discuss the syntax.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Thoughts on Chapter~\ref{proto1}}

\begin{figure}
\begin{minted}[linenos,frame=lines]{haskell}

      deriving (Eq, Data, Typeable, Ord)
data Atom         = Atom      !String

\end{minted}
  \vspace*{-1.0\baselineskip}
  \caption{A sample Minted figure}
  \label{fig:sample}
\end{figure}
I am looking at what are currently lines 145--\textit{on} in
\Verb!proto1.tex!, and I am not sure whether 
\begin{compactenum}
\item
  the text should be loose---as you have it, or floated to a figure, as shown
  in Figure~\ref{fig:sample}.
\item
  I am also not sure whether I like the inlined code, or whether I would
  prefer to have it \Verb!\inputminted! from a \progLang{Haskell} file.
  I suppose that this depends on your work-flow.  Thoughts?
\end{compactenum}

I am not sure what conventions you are following with respect to code in
text.
At some point you have \Verb!FlatTerm! in italics (\'a la
\textit{FlatTerm}); at other points you have it typeset in straight
double quotes ("FlatTerm") and I don't know what the different
typesetting implies.

Just above Section~\ref{proto1}.5 you mention a generic function
\Verb[formatcom=\color{blue}]!map!,
which for \progLang{Standard ML} and \progLang{Haskell} readers likely
means the function with signature
\Verb!(a -> b) -> ([a] -> [b])!\,.
Why not 
\Verb[formatcom=\color{blue}]!fmap!?

I am not sure what the point of the \P{} before Section~\ref{proto1}.5
is. 

\paragraph{Thoughts on 1.1}

We need to firmly fix in mind who the target audience is.  Some
possibilities
\begin{enumerate}
\item Undergraduate Physics students
\item Undergraduate Computer Science students
\item
  Future graduate students of Casperson who have just begun their
  thesis work.
\item
  Simon Peyton-Jones.
\end{enumerate}
If we assume (3), then the material in the first paragraph and part of
the second are unnecessary.

\paragraph{Thoughts on 1.3}

I am unsure that I can summarize this subsection in two sentences.  I
don't know what the problem statement is at the end of it.

\paragraph{Thoughts on 1.4}

Rename to ``Thesis Organization''.

\paragraph{Thoughts on Chapter 2}

Here are some potential keywords from Chapter 2:
\begin{inparaitem}
\item Hindley-Milner type systems
\item Horn clauses
\item \(\lambda\)-calculi
\item \textsc{Haskell}
\item \textsc{Scala}
\item declarative programming languages
\item foreign function interfaces
\item functional programming
\item implementing Prolog in other languages
\item language embedding
\item language families
\item language paradigms
\item logic programming
\item meta-programming
\item monads
\item paradigm integration
\item quasi-quotation
\item the typed \(\lambda\)-calculus
\item the untyped \(\lambda\)-calculus
\end{inparaitem}.

What is the overall message?
