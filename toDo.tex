\textit{\color{red} This Chapter needs to be removed from the final
  work.}

\begin{enumerate}
\item [\textbf{Either}]
\item Rename ``\Verb!proposal.*!'' to ``\Verb!thesis-solanki.*!''.
\item Switch the thesis style to UNBC thesis style.  (Not urgent, if
  this breaks other tools, we can do this last, but it would be nice to
  have a sense of what the thesis is going to look like.)
\item
  Check the rules for spacing in the bibliography to ensure that we have
  them right.
  
\item [\textbf{David}]
\item Review Chapter 1
\item Review Chapter 2
\item Review Chapter 3
\item Review Chapter 4
\item Review Chapter 5
\item Review Chapter 6
\item Review Chapter 7
\item Review Chapter 8

\item [\textbf{Mehul}]
\item
  Fix the reference at the bottom of page~2:
  \Verb!citewikipro- log,somogyi1995logic,website:prolog1000db.!
\item
  Write enough of Chapters \ref{proto1}--\ref{proto4} that we can decide
  what material is needed in Chapters~ \ref{sect:quasiquotation},
  \ref{sect:metasyntacticvariables},
  and~\ref{sect:relatedtermskeywords}.

\subsection{Editing suggestions from David}\label{sec:edit-sugg-david}

\paragraph{Thoughts on 1.1}

We need to firmly fix in mind who the target audience is.  Some
possibilities
\begin{enumerate}
\item Undergraduate Physics students
\item Undergraduate Computer Science students
\item
  Future graduate students of Casperson who have just begun their
  thesis work.
\item
  Simon Peyton-Jones.
\end{enumerate}
If we assume (3), then the material in the first paragraph and part of
the second are unnecessary.

\paragraph{Thoughts on 1.3}

I am unsure that I can summarize this subsection in two sentences.  I
don't know what the problem statement is at the end of it.

\paragraph{Thoughts on 1.4}

Rename to 


\end{enumerate}
