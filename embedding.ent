I
believe
that
the
list
of
facts
that
you
are
trying
to
combine
is:
\begin
{compactitem}
\item
One
of
the
implementations
discussed
on
``Lambda
The
Ultimate''
leads
us
something.
\item
\texttt
{Mini
Prolog}
(\cite
{website:mini-prolog-hugs98})
is
one
of
the
earliest
implementations
of
\progLang
{Prolog}
in
\progLang
{Haskell}.
\item
\texttt
{Mini
Prolog}
works
with
\progLang
{Hugs
98},
an
early
dialect
of
\progLang
{Haskell}.
