This thesis set out to explore the various approaches used for bringing features of multiple languages into a single 
programming environment, and has identified embedding and paradigm integration as being the major ones. This study has also sought to improve
the existing work on implementing \progLang{Prolog} in \progLang{Haskell}. One contribution of this thesis is a  
\progLang{Prolog}-like language in \progLang{Haskell} which not only is closer to a ``real'' \progLang{Prolog} distribution but also provides 
logic programming functionality as natively as possible in the host language.

During this process we have also thrown light on the subject of eDSLs in \progLang{Haskell} and the support for the same. Moreover, we
have provided a methodology for replicating results achieved in this thesis.

\progLang{Haskell} has been shown to be an effective tool for embedding DSLs.
